# LANBooru

i'm the worst in the world at writing readme files, so sorry

to run, make sure you have docker installed on your system and the repo downloaded

then set up a .env file in the root of the project (can copy from .env.example for a reference) and run `docker compose up` to start
- Note: The Docker file is set up by default to mount your C:\ drive as its root directory for adding images, but if you're on a Linux system you may have to uncomment one of the other options. Look in docker-compose.yml for examples.

access LANBooru from https://127.0.0.1 after it starts up

Report any issues/problems to me as a Github issue!
